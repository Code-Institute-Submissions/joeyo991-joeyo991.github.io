# User Experience

## Site Structure

The Premier League Quiz website is a single page with a quiz in the shape of a form for the user to complete.

## Design Choices

 * ### Typography
     The chosen font for the page was 'Readex Pro'. This font was chosen because it is easy to read, it is stylish, and because it is very similar to the official Premier League font.

 * ### Colour Scheme
     The colour scheme chosen for the page was based on the Official Premier League colour scheme for the 2021/2022 season. It features white, a pink (Amaranth) and a purple (Russian Violet).
